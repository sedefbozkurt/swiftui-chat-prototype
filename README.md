# SwiftUI Chat Prototype

A chat prototype application built with **SwiftUI** using **MVVM architecture**
This project focuses on clean UI, proper state management and scalable project structure following real-world iOS development practices.

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this project is to explore and demonstrate how a one-to-one chat interface
can be structured in SwiftUI with production-oriented thinking.

> This is a prototype, not a production-ready application.

## 🧱 Architecture

- SwiftUI
- MVVM
- Single source of truth via ViewModel
- Mock data (no backend integration yet)

## ✨ Features (Planned)

- One-to-one chat UI
- Message bubbles (sent / received)
- Auto-scrolling message list
- Input bar with send action
- Dark mode support

Built with ❤️ to practice real-world SwiftUI architecture.
